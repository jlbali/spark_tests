# spark_tests
Tests with Spark on Python

Installati√≥n:

- pipenv:

pip install pipenv

Try installing one package at a time from the Pipenv if it gets stuck on "locking". Comment the lines in the Pipfile (TOML format) with #.

- pyspark

pipenv install pyspark

No longer necessary the previous Spark installation steps.

- PyCharm

Directly open the project with the Pipfile present, it will interpret it correctly as a Pipenv
project. Do not use "New Project".


Issues:

- Cannot install Spyder through pipenv. Strange error.

- Hint Typing: look how to declare types for variables.
